 Lab 3 - Model Water Rocket Code


The program works through a command line interface (CLI) and once the numbers have been crunched the program displays an animated 2D flight path of a water bottle rocket. 

The program has two focuses:
- Compute the mathematical model of the water bottle rocket's various stages of flight to determine its' trajectory.
- Make the program interactive so it can be used to teach students in various grades.
